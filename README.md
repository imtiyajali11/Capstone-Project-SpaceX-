# Capstone-Project-SpaceX-
A private space launch company as a Final Project.

Hello! And welcome to this capstone course.  

This is a capstone Project. Here we will apply our data science skills as a Data scientist for a private space launch company in this project.    

As a starting point of almost all data science projects, We need to collect data, as much and relevant as possible.

We will be collecting data from various sources. After raw data has been collected, we will need to improve the quality by performing data wrangling. 

Then we can start exploring the processed data.  We will explore some really interesting real-world datasets together. Will get to practice  SQL skills as we query the data and gather insights.  

Will gain further insights into the data by applying some basic statistical analysis and data visualization, Will be able to see directly how variables might be related to each other.   

 We'll drill down into finer levels of detail by splitting the data into groups defined by categorical variables or factors in our data.  

We will be guided to build, evaluate, and refine predictive models for discovering more exciting insights. 

The final task of this capstone project is to create a presentation that will be developed into stories of all your analysis.

Thanks and good luck!
